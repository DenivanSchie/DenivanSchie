# Welcome to My GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Deni van Schie, a PhD student in the **Laboratory of Experimental Oncology and Radiobiology** at Amsterdam UMC. My research focuses on understanding the molecular intricacies of **cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)** in the tumor microenvironment of gastrointestinal cancers, specifically esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). I am passionate about integrating **bioinformatics** with experimental oncology to unravel the contributions of CAF subtypes to therapy resistance and prognosis.

## Research Interests ðŸ§¬

- **Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs)**: Exploring CAF heterogeneity and its clinical implications, especially in EAC.
- **Tumor Microenvironment**: Investigating how CAFs interact with cancer cells and contribute to therapy resistance.
- **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology**: Applying computational approaches to analyze complex biological data, develop CAF-related markers, and build a pan-GI CAF atlas.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilizing **R**, **Python**, and **bash** for data analysis, visualization, and reproducibility in cancer research.
